- 👋 Hi, I’m @brazierce, aka Charlotte.
- 😄 Pronouns: She / Her.
- 🤓 I'm a wannabe tech career changer, currently enrolled on the CFG Degree with a Data Science specialisation. It's a little bit ironic since I spent the last 10 years in commercial real estate, rebelling against my undergrad degree which leaned heavily towards statistics and maths...life is a journey!
- 👀 I'm looking to build a life that i'm proud of, and that starts with finding meaningful work that does some good in this world. I think tech is the perfect gateway to this. 
- 🌱 I’m learning to be proud of the fact that I want my life to go in a different direction, and that I'm actively pursuing this even though it's uncomfortable. 
- 🏕️ I recently discovered that i THRIVE in the wilderness! There's nothing like realising that you have all the things you need to be happy in your backpack, and all the skills to survive in your soul. 
- 💥 My superpower is that I 'don't look the type', so I get to surprise people when they get to know me. I don't look the type to...lead the meetings rather than take the minutes, have thru-hiked solo into the Arctic, be into self-sufficiency and watching Gardener's World, be a badass at Deadlifts, bungee jump and skydive whenever the opportunity arises...

- ⚡ Fun fact: Save the planet - use empty toilet roll tubes as DIY pots for sowing seeds. Once your seedlings are ready, plant the tube directly into the ground. The cardboard will break down and your plant babies will thank you for it 🤗
